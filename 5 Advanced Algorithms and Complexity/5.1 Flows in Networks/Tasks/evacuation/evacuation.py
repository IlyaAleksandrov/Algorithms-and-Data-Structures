# Problem Introduction
# In this problem, you will apply an algorithm for finding maximum flow
# in a network to determine how fast people can be evacuated from the
# given city.

# Task. A tornado is approaching the city, and we need to evacuate the people quickly. There are several
# roads outgoing from the city to the nearest cities and other roads going further. The goal is to evacuate
# everybody from the city to the capital, as it is the only other city which is able to accomodate that
# many newcomers. We need to evacuate everybody as fast as possible, and your task is to find out
# what is the maximum number of people that can be evacuated each hour given the capacities of all
# the roads.

# Input Format. The first line of the input contains integers 𝑛 and 𝑚 — the number of cities and the number
# of roads respectively. Each of the next 𝑚 lines contains three integers 𝑢, 𝑣 and 𝑐 describing a particular
# road — start of the road, end of the road and the number of people that can be transported through
# this road in one hour. 𝑢 and 𝑣 are the 1-based indices of the corresponding cities.
# The city from which people are evacuating is the city number 1, and the capital city is the city number
# 𝑛.
# Note that all the roads are given as one-directional, that is, you cannot transport people
# from 𝑣 to 𝑢 using a road that connects 𝑢 to 𝑣. Also note that there can be several roads
# connecting the same city 𝑢 to the same city 𝑣, there can be both roads from 𝑢 to 𝑣 and
# from 𝑣 to 𝑢, or there can be only roads in one direction, or there can be no roads between
# a pair of cities. Also note that there can be roads going from a city 𝑢 to itself in the
# input.
# When evacuating people, they cannot stop in the middle of the road or in any city other than the
# capital. The number of people per hour entering any city other than the evacuating city 1 and the
# capital city 𝑛 must be equal to the number of people per hour exiting from this city. People who left
# a city 𝑢 through some road (𝑢, 𝑣, 𝑐) are assumed to come immediately after that to the city 𝑣. We
# are interested in the maximum possible number of people per hour leaving the city 1 under the above
# restrictions.

# Constraints. 1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 100; 0 ≤ 𝑚 ≤ 10 000; 1 ≤ 𝑢, 𝑣 ≤ 𝑛; 1 ≤ 𝑐 ≤ 10 000. It is guaranteed that
# 𝑚 · EvacuatePerHour ≤ 2 · 10^8, where EvacuatePerHour is the maximum number of people that can
# be evacuated from the city each hour — the number which you need to output.

# Output Format. Output a single integer — the maximum number of people that can be evacuated from
# the city number 1 each hour.

# Example of input:
# 4 5
# 1 2 10000
# 1 3 10000
# 2 3 1
# 3 4 10000
# 2 4 10000
# Output:
# 20000
#
# Explanation:
# We can evacuate 10000 people through the route 1 − 2 − 4 and additional 10000 people through the
# route 1−3−4 totalling in 20000 people per hour. It is impossible to evacuate more people each hour,
# as the total capacity of the roads outgoing from the city number 1 is 20000 people per hour.
# Pay attention to this example if you think of using a simple Ford–Fulkerson algorithm. Note how it
# works on such graph, and why it may be a bad idea to use this algorithm on big networks with large
# capacities.
