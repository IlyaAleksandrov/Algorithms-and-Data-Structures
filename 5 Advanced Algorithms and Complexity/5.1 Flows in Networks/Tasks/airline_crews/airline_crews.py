# Problem Introduction
# In this problem, you will apply an algorithm for finding maximum matching
# in a bipartite graph to assign airline crews to flights in the most
# efficient way.

# Task. The airline offers a bunch of flights and has a set of crews that can work on those flights. However,
# the flights are starting in different cities and at different times, so only some of the crews are able to
# work on a particular flight. You are given the pairs of flights and associated crews that can work on
# those flights. You need to assign crews to as many flights as possible and output all the assignments.

# Input Format. The first line of the input contains integers 𝑛 and 𝑚 — the number of flights and the number
# of crews respectively. Each of the next 𝑛 lines contains 𝑚 binary integers (0 or 1). If the 𝑗-th integer
# in the 𝑖-th line is 1, then the crew number 𝑗 can work on the flight number 𝑖, and if it is 0, then it
# cannot.

# Constraints. 1 ≤ 𝑛,𝑚 ≤ 100.

# Output Format. Output 𝑛 integers — for each flight, output the 1-based index of the crew assigned to
# this flight. If no crew is assigned to a flight, output −1 as the index of the crew corresponding to it.
# All the positive indices in the output must be between 1 and 𝑚, and they must be pairwise different,
# but you can output any number of −1’s. If there are several assignments with the maximum possible
# number of flights having a crew assigned, output any of them.

# Example of input:
# 2 2
# 1 1
# 1 0

# Output:
# 2 1

# Explanation:

# If we assign the first crew to the first flight, we won’t be able to assign any crew to the second flight.
# It is optimal to assign the second crew to the first flight and the first crew to the second flight, because
# this way we have a crew assigned to each flight.
