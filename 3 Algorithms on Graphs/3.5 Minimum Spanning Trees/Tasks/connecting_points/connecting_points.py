# Problem Introduction
# In this problem, the goal is to build roads between some pairs of the
# given cities such that there is a path between any two cities and the
# total length of the roads is minimized.

# Task. Given n points on a plane, connect them with segments of minimum total length such that there is a
# path between any two points. Recall that the length of a segment with endpoints (x1; y1) and (x2; y2)
# is equal to ((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2)^(1/2).

# Input Format. The first line contains the number n of points. Each of the following n lines defines a point
# (xi; yi).

# Constraints. 1 <= n <= 200; -10^3 <= xi, yi <= 10^3 are integers. All points are pairwise different, no three
# points lie on the same line.

# Output Format. Output the minimum total length of segments. The absolute value of the difference
# between the answer of your program and the optimal value should be at most 10^-6. To ensure this,
# output your answer with at least seven digits after the decimal point (otherwise your answer, while
# being computed correctly, can turn out to be wrong because of rounding issues).
