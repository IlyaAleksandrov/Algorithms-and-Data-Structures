# Problem Introduction
# Now, you are interested in minimizing not the number of segments, but the total cost of a flight. For this
# you construct a weighted graph: the weight of an edge from one city to another one is the cost of the
# corresponding flight.

# Task. Given an directed graph with positive edge weights and with n vertices and m edges as well as two
# vertices u and v, compute the weight of a shortest path between u and v (that is, the minimum total
# weight of a path from u to v).

# Input Format. A graph is given in the standard format. The next line contains two vertices u and v.

# Constraints. 1 <= n <= 10^3, 0 <= m <= 10^5, u != v, 1 <= u; v <= n, edge weights are non-negative integers not
# exceeding 103.

# Output Format. Output the minimum weight of a path from u to v, or ô€€€1 if there is no path.

# Explanation:
# There is a unique shortest path from vertex 1 to vertex 3 in this graph (1 - 2 - 3), and it has weight 3.
