# Problem Introduction
# In this problem you are going to solve the same problem as the previous one, but for a more general case,
# when binary search tree may contain equal keys.

# Task. You are given a binary tree with integers as its keys. You need to test whether it is a correct binary
# search tree. Note that there can be duplicate integers in the tree, and this is allowed. The definition of
# the binary search tree in such case is the following: for any node of the tree, if its key is 𝑥, then for any
# node in its left subtree its key must be strictly less than 𝑥, and for any node in its right subtree its key
# must be greater than or equal to 𝑥. In other words, smaller elements are to the left, bigger elements
# are to the right, and duplicates are always to the right. You need to check whether the given binary
# tree structure satisfies this condition. You are guaranteed that the input contains a valid binary tree.
# That is, it is a tree, and each node has at most two children.

# Input Format. The first line contains the number of vertices 𝑛. The vertices of the tree are numbered
# from 0 to 𝑛 − 1. Vertex 0 is the root.
# The next 𝑛 lines contain information about vertices 0, 1, ..., 𝑛−1 in order. Each of these lines contains
# three integers 𝑘𝑒𝑦𝑖, 𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑡𝑖 and 𝑟𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑖 — 𝑘𝑒𝑦𝑖 is the key of the 𝑖-th vertex, 𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑡𝑖 is the index of the left
# child of the 𝑖-th vertex, and 𝑟𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑖 is the index of the right child of the 𝑖-th vertex. If 𝑖 doesn’t have
# left or right child (or both), the corresponding 𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑡𝑖 or 𝑟𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑖 (or both) will be equal to −1.

# Constraints. 0 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 105; −231 ≤ 𝑘𝑒𝑦𝑖 ≤ 231 − 1; −1 ≤ 𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑡𝑖, 𝑟𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑖 ≤ 𝑛 − 1. It is guaranteed that the
# input represents a valid binary tree. In particular, if 𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑡𝑖 ̸= −1 and 𝑟𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑖 ̸= −1, then 𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑡𝑖 ̸= 𝑟𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑖.
# Also, a vertex cannot be a child of two different vertices. Also, each vertex is a descendant of the root
# vertex. Note that the minimum and the maximum possible values of the 32-bit integer type are allowed
# to be keys in the tree — beware of integer overflow!

# Output Format. If the given binary tree is a correct binary search tree (see the definition in the problem
# description), output one word “CORRECT” (without quotes). Otherwise, output one word “INCORRECT”
# (without quotes).
