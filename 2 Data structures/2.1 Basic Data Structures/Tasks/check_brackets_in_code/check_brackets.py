# Problem Introduction
# In this problem you will implement a feature for a text editor to find errors in the usage of brackets in the
# code.

# Task. Your friend is making a text editor for programmers. He is currently working on a feature that will
# find errors in the usage of different types of brackets. Code can contain any brackets from the set
# []{}(), where the opening brackets are [,{, and ( and the closing brackets corresponding to them
# are ],}, and ).
# For convenience, the text editor should not only inform the user that there is an error in the usage
# of brackets, but also point to the exact place in the code with the problematic bracket. First priority
# is to find the first unmatched closing bracket which either doesn‚Äôt have an opening bracket before it,
# like ] in ](), or closes the wrong opening bracket, like } in ()[}. If there are no such mistakes, then
# it should find the first unmatched opening bracket without the corresponding closing bracket after it,
# like ( in {}([]. If there are no mistakes, text editor should inform the user that the usage of brackets
# is correct.
# Apart from the brackets, code can contain big and small latin letters, digits and punctuation marks.
# More formally, all brackets in the code should be divided into pairs of matching brackets, such that in
# each pair the opening bracket goes before the closing bracket, and for any two pairs of brackets either
# one of them is nested inside another one as in (foo[bar]) or they are separate as in f(a,b)-g[c].
# The bracket [ corresponds to the bracket ], { corresponds to }, and ( corresponds to ).

# Input Format. Input contains one string ùëÜ which consists of big and small latin letters, digits, punctuation
# marks and brackets from the set []{}().

# Constraints. The length of ùëÜ is at least 1 and at most 105.

# Output Format. If the code in ùëÜ uses brackets correctly, output ‚ÄúSuccess" (without the quotes). Otherwise,
# output the 1-based index of the first unmatched closing bracket, and if there are no unmatched closing
# brackets, output the 1-based index of the first unmatched opening bracket.
