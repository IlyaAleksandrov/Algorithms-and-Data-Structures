# Problem Introduction
# In this problem you will convert an array of integers into a heap. This is the crucial step of the sorting
# algorithm called HeapSort. It has guaranteed worst-case running time of 𝑂(𝑛 log 𝑛) as opposed to QuickSort’s
# average running time of 𝑂(𝑛 log 𝑛). QuickSort is usually used in practice, because typically it is faster, but
# HeapSort is used for external sort when you need to sort huge files that don’t fit into memory of your
# computer.

# Task. The first step of the HeapSort algorithm is to create a heap from the array you want to sort. By the
# way, did you know that algorithms based on Heaps are widely used for external sort, when you need
# to sort huge files that don’t fit into memory of a computer?
# Your task is to implement this first step and convert a given array of integers into a heap. You will
# do that by applying a certain number of swaps to the array. Swap is an operation which exchanges
# elements 𝑎𝑖 and 𝑎𝑗 of the array 𝑎 for some 𝑖 and 𝑗. You will need to convert the array into a heap
# using only 𝑂(𝑛) swaps, as was described in the lectures. Note that you will need to use a min-heap
# instead of a max-heap in this problem.

# Input Format. The first line of the input contains single integer 𝑛. The next line contains 𝑛 space-separated
# integers 𝑎𝑖.

# Constraints. 1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 100 000; 0 ≤ 𝑖, 𝑗 ≤ 𝑛 − 1; 0 ≤ 𝑎0, 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛−1 ≤ 10^9. All 𝑎𝑖 are distinct.

# Output Format. The first line of the output should contain single integer 𝑚 — the total number of swaps.
# 𝑚 must satisfy conditions 0 ≤ 𝑚 ≤ 4𝑛. The next 𝑚 lines should contain the swap operations used
# to convert the array 𝑎 into a heap. Each swap is described by a pair of integers 𝑖, 𝑗 — the 0-based
# indices of the elements to be swapped. After applying all the swaps in the specified order the array
# must become a heap, that is, for each 𝑖 where 0 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 𝑛 − 1 the following conditions must be true:
# 1. If 2𝑖 + 1 ≤ 𝑛 − 1, then 𝑎𝑖 < 𝑎2𝑖+1.
# 2. If 2𝑖 + 2 ≤ 𝑛 − 1, then 𝑎𝑖 < 𝑎2𝑖+2.
# Note that all the elements of the input array are distinct. Note that any sequence of swaps that has
# length at most 4𝑛 and after which your initial array becomes a correct heap will be graded as correct.
