# Problem Introduction
# The Burrows‚ÄìWheeler transform of a string Text permutes the symbols of Text so that it becomes well
# compressible. Moreover, the transformation is reversible: one can recover the initial string Text from its
# Burrows‚ÄìWheeler transform. However, data compression is not its only application: it is also used for solving
# the multiple pattern matching problem and the sequence alignment problem.
# BWT(Text) is defined as follows. First, form all possible cyclic rotations of Text; a cyclic rotation is
# defined by chopping off a suffix from the end of Text and appending this suffix to the beginning of Text.
# Then, order all the cyclic rotations of Text lexicographically to form a |Text| √ó |Text| matrix of symbols
# denoted by ùëÄ(Text). BWT(Text) is the last column of ùëÄ(Text)

# Task. Construct the Burrows‚ÄìWheeler transform of a string.

# Input Format. A string Text ending with a ‚Äú$‚Äù symbol.

# Constraints. 1 ‚â§ |Text| ‚â§ 1 000; except for the last symbol, Text contains symbols A, C, G, T only.

# Output Format. BWT(Text).
